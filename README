SuffixArray version 1.0
=======================

FULL NAME:

Suffix array computation tool 


DESCRIPTION:

Suffix array is a data structure used commonly for full text indices, 
data compression algorithms and in various matching algorithms in 
bioinformatics and computational biology. It is an array of indices 
each corresponding to a starting position of a suffix in a given string. 
This software is a C++ encapsulation of sais-light-2.4.1 library written 
by Yuta Mori [1] implementing the induced sorting [2] based suffix 
array construction algorithm. 


SYNOPSIS:

    #include<vector>
    #include<SuffixArray.hpp>

    string text("This is my text");
  

/* Make SuffixArray */

    /* Construction */
    SuffixArray<int|long|unsigned|double> SA(text);
    /*  OR  */
    SuffixArray<int|long|unsigned|double> SA;
    SA.make(text);
    
/* Get Array */

   vector<int|long|unsigned|double>Array = SA.GetSuffixArray();    // [15 4 7 10 0 12 1 2 5 8 3 6 14 11 13 9]



CONSTRUCTION AND RUNTIME COMPLEXITY:

For: 

|S| - input string size

    The algorithm runs in O(|S|) worst-case time
